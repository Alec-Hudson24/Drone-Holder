# Drone-Holder
**Custom 3D-printed wall-mounted holder for secure drone storage for a DJI Mavic 3 Classic with precise geometric fit**  
*(Personal DIY project: 3D modeling, iterative design, 3D printing)*

## Goal / Overview
- **Primary Features**:
  - Precision-modeled cradle: Custom geometry ensures the drone sits securely without slipping or falling, tailored to exact drone dimensions.
  - Wall-mounted design: Easy installation on any wall to save desk/space and keep the drone protected and accessible.
  - Iterative refinement: Multiple design versions tested and improved for better fit, strength, and stability.
- **Motivation**: Provide a safe, space-efficient way to store and display a drone when not in use — preventing damage from clutter, accidental knocks, or improper placement.
- **Outcome**: Fully functional, printed prototype that holds the drone reliably; geometry optimized through several iterations for a snug, no-wobble fit.

## Programs and skills required
- **3D Modeling & Design**: SolidWorks (precise parametric modeling, measurements for drone fit, iterative revisions, STL export for printing)
- **3D Printing**: Slicing software (Bambu Labs), printer calibration, material selection, post-processing (sanding/support removal)
- **Other**: Measurement and reverse-engineering (taking accurate drone dimensions), prototyping mindset, testing iterations for fit and durability

## Key Takeaways and lessons
- Precise geometry and tight tolerances are critical for secure holding — small changes in angles or clearances make a big difference in stability.
- Iterative design pays off: Each version revealed issues (e.g., weak spots, poor alignment) that were fixed quickly with 3D printing's fast turnaround.
- Always measure twice (or more) before final modeling — real-world drone quirks (props, arms, battery bulge) require adjustments beyond initial sketches.
- Strong infill/wall settings and material choice improve load-bearing for heavier drones without adding much weight.

## Future Improvements / Ideas
- Add adjustable arms or modular inserts for different drone sizes/models.
- Integrate cable management clips for charging cables or accessories.
- Print in stronger materials (e.g., PETG/ABS) or add reinforcements for larger/heavier drones.
- Wall-mount variations (e.g., shelf-style stand or multi-drone rack).
